Making variables:
Variables store values that can be accessed and used in code.

let variableName = 'text', numbers, or arrays [];
example of a string variable
let name = 'John';  or let name = "John";

example of a number variable:
let oranges  = 5;

example of an array:
let myarray = [];

To view output in the console, you have to use console.log.
Example of console.log using previously stated variable name.
console.log(name);
>> John

Variables can be reassigned so long as it had the word 'let' before it.
Example:
name = 'Jane';
console.log(name);
>> Jane
*sine the variable 'name' has already been declared once, you do not have to use 'let'.
